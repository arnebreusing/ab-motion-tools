### ab-maskToLastSelected.jsx
Apply the Set Matte effect to all selected layers and set the last selected layer as mask.

### ab-parentToLastSelected.jsx
Easily select your layers in the viewport and link them with this script to the last selected layer. No need to pick whip or scroll long layer dropdown lists.
